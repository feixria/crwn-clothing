/**
 * ! There is alot of change from React Router v5 -> v6
 * ! Be very wary when going through the courses
 * ? What changed ?
 * 1 ) Inside Route, there is no more component attributes or prop anymore. This is replaced with element
 * 2 ) Within the Route component, the exact keyword is also removed. Now it is enabled default and route checking is improved
 * 3 ) Switching is removed and fused with Routes
 * 4 ) props doesn't contain anymore, what u get u have to do it manually to get the params and query
 * 5 ) there is no props.history.push anymore. You have to do this through the usage of const navigate = useNavigate() navigate('/desiredRoute')
